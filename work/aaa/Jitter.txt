     The tasting app is coming together and I will be pushing a release candidate tonight.

     Anytime next week would be a good time to meet, so I propose Mon. at 1:00 PM

      The biggest task left is to integrate the app into WordPress

      New Features in tonight's release:

      1. Navigation arrows on the left and right
      2. The top circles also perform navigation with enhancements for indicating
         where you at where you going.
      3. All Choices are limited to 3, but now they rollover by removing the earliest
         choices without the alerts for an improved user experience.

      Upcoming Features:

      1. Prompts for informing the customers what the app is about and what they can do with it
      2. More complete information in the Summaries
