Maxwell,

   Here the 6 things I need to discuss with you to integrate the Taste App
into your JitterBox WordPress site

1. "My Tastes" in Memu Bar

2. Link to Taste App with an IFrame

  [ iframe src="https://jitter-48413.firebaseapp.com/" width="100%" height="100%" ]

3. Plan to store taste profiles in the users table meta field as a JSON string.

4. Need to set up WordPress security with perhaps a Taste App user id and password
   to enable Rest access.

5. Need to figure out how to determine the current user to get their WordPress user id.

6. Once the Taste App gets the user id it can read and write the taste profile
   in the meta field with Rest.

The Taste App will display a summary of the Taste Profile for curation.

So email me your thoughts and we can have a phone conversation soon.

  Tom
